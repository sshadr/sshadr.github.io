I am a Computer Science Masters student at Saarland University, advised by [Thomas Leimkühler]("https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~tleimkue/"). I'm broadly interested in research problems at the intersection of Computer Graphics and Computer Vision. I am also interested in photo-realistic algorithms in Computer graphics and take inspiration from physics and nature to design advanced algorithms for Image generation.

<!-- My current research involved modelling images (natural or artificial) and hence can be encoded by repeated primitives. To this end, I use Differentiable rendering to design a ML Style Optimization system.

I currently work with the [IsMaeL group]("https://ismael.mpi-inf.mpg.de"), at the Max Planck Institute For Informatics, as a Research Assistant, helping in the construction of a unifying library for usage within the group employing OpenGL, C++, Cuda, Python. -->
