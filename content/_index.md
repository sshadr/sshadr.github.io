I'm broadly interested in research problems at the intersection of Computer Graphics and Computer Vision, some of which are Rendering and Simulation, Physics-based systems, Inverse problems, Generative modelling.
<!-- I am also interested in photo-realistic algorithms in Computer graphics and take inspiration from physics and nature to design advanced algorithms. -->

I currently work with [Thomas Leimkühler](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~tleimkue/) and the [IsMaeL group](https://ismael.mpi-inf.mpg.de), at the Max Planck Institute For Informatics, constructing a unifying library for usage within the group employing OpenGL, C++, CUDA, Python.

<!-- <span style="color:#ffd000;"><em>Always excited to collaborate on challenging projects, and open to internship opportunities starting late 2027!</em></span> -->
